### Why bevy?

To build 3d realtime applications, we must choose an 3d engine or build an 3d engine.
After doing some research, we have those choices: Unreal, Unity, GoDot, Bevy or build by ourselves.

#### Goals
- Free
- Open source
- High-performance
- Mature
- Wrote with Rust

#### Compare

Score: 5 is best and 1 is worse.

| | Unreal | Unity | GoDot | Bevy | Build by ourselves | Explain |
| --- | --- | ---  | ---  | ---  |  ---  |  ---  |
| Free | 1 | 1 | 5 | 5| 5| |
| Open-source | 3 | 1 | 5 | 5| 5| Unreal is partly open-source(not MIT or Apache).|
| High-performance | 5 | 4 | 3 | 3| 2 |  |
| Mature | 5 | 5 | 3 | 2| 1 | |
| Rust | 1 | 1 | 1 | 5 | 5 | We have chose Rust as our programming language.|
| Total | 15 | 12 | 17 | 20 | 18 | |

So we choose Bevy as our engine.
