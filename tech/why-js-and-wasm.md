### Why do we choose js and wasm as our programming language for the modding system?
- Web is the future. We must embrace Web technologies and support Web as one of our primary platforms.
- JavaScript is one of the most popular langauges in the world, compared to lua(the common language for modding).
- JavaScript is easy to use, compared to Rust or C/C++?
- JavaScript is the natural language on the Web and we don't have to load an extra runtime like C# or Java.
